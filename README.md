# Sequential and parallel LSD radix sorts

Developed in April, 2019.

## Description

Sequential and parallel implementations of LSD radix sort. Sequential radix sort is a rather straightforward algorithm. Parallel radix sort is parallelized both in the counting phase and the reorganizing phase. Multicore processing is achieved using Java's ForkJoinTask framework.

Both algorithms can be tested and benchmarked against Scala's own implementation of quicksort, i.e., `scala.util.Sorting.quickSort` by running `main.scala`. This script checks the validity of the algorithms and times them algorithms against quicksort using System.nanoTime. The algorithms sort 32-bit signed integers by grouping them into 8-bit sized batches.



## Software prerequisites

Built on Scala 2.12.8 and JDK 1.8.0_202. All required packages are included in `/common`.

From the logarithmic plot it can be infered that both radixSort and radixSortPar are proportional to quickSort and each other. Roughly, the runtime of quickSort is proportinal to radixSort with constant 6, and to radixSortPar with constant 13.
